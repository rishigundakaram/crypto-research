steps: 
1. gather historical data
3 from each catergory
transaction mechanism - Bitcoin, litecoin, ZCash
distributed computation -  Ethereum, EOS, DFinity, (Tezos, DFinity)
utility - Golem, storj, sia
security - STOs (what coins are here)
fungible - ERC-20
non-fungible - (ERC-721, Dhrama debt, Cryptokitties, Decentraland)
stablecoins - 4 catergories, collateralized differently (probably can do a whole svd on just this)
    fiat currency - tether, USDC, (LBXPeg, candy)
    assets - Digix Gold, (Tiberius coin, Swiss Real Coin)
    cryptocurrency - MakerDao
    uncollateralized - basecoin

Let's attempt to use data from mostly one site
Assumptions
- price discrepencies between different coin exchanges are not 
significant in the long term. 

2020-12-15
all coins from coin gecko
need about 10 more coins from coins pre 2017
month is definitely the way to go

### TODO
1. ensure that extremely high variance data is not included towards the beginning of a cryptos life
